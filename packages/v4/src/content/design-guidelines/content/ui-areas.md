# UI areas
When designing for different UI areas, don't forget about your words. Keep these best practices in mind so that you can deliver the right content along with your design.

## Onboarding flows and tours

Onboarding flows are a series of dialog boxes or pop-ups that introduce a new tool—or a tool redesign—to a user.

In onboarding flows, your UX copy is never strictly to tell a user how something works. You need to convince them that the product—and learning about the product—is worth their time.

**Focus on the user’s goals**: Emphasize what the user can do with the product.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>We introduced a new feature for designing called Flyer Fact. Discover how it works by taking a tour to learn more. <center>OK | Cancel</center></td>
        <td>Create consistency and design faster with Flyer Fact.<center>Start tour | Not now
        </center></td>
    </tr>
</table>


**Be conversational**: Imagine that you’re sitting beside the user and walking them through the product. Avoid jargon and be casual.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>There are three major areas of Flyer Fact: components, layouts, and documentation. These are for designers to utilize in order to build user experiences that serve the needs of their users.</td>
        <td>Create accessible and intuitive interfaces with Flyer Fact’s components, layouts, and documentation.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


**Empathize with the user**: Learning new things can be scary, so don’t stuff your onboarding flow with exclamation marks, and avoid telling the user how hard you worked on the new tool or how excited you are. Instead, understand that the user might be a little intimidated. Focus on giving them information and guidance in a straightforward way.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>We are so excited to announce the Flyer Fact redesign! We can’t wait to show you around.</td>
        <td>Flyer Fact has a new look. Let’s explore what you can do.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Error messages
An error message is a message indicating something went wrong. A user usually sees an error message when they attempt to perform an action but cannot continue because something isn’t right.

**Don’t blame users**. A user should never feel like the error is their fault. Avoid language like “You did something wrong.”

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>You entered the wrong password.</td>
        <td>The password is incorrect.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**Give users a next step**: A user should never feel stuck. If they’re hit with an error, give them the information they need to continue with their task.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Your list already has the maximum number of items. You are not able to continue customizing.</td>
        <td>Your list has the maximum number of items. To continue customizing, remove one item.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**Avoid jargon**: Error messages are frustrating enough without technical terms that users might not understand. Avoid jargon and use terms that are familiar to your users.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Error code 5959: Outdated version information. Task termination pending.</td>
        <td>Your task is outdated. To keep it active, update its version.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


**Include the right amount of description**: Tell your user what is wrong. An error without an explanation can add to their frustration and prevent them from finding a solution.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>An error occurred. The email cannot be sent.</td>
        <td>To send this email, turn on your email permissions in user settings.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

However, don’t include too much information. The user doesn’t need to know exactly what is going on behind the scenes. Only give them information about what went wrong and what they can do next.

<table align="center" style="margin: 0px auto; table-layout:fixed;" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center>Before</center></th>
        <th><center>After</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Your information cannot be saved. Our system is currently designed to accommodate 1 record per user. The system memory is unable to store more at this time.</td>
        <td>Only 1 record can be saved. To continue, remove one of your records.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
