A **hint** is in-app messaging that provides a one-step reminder, explanation, or call to action for a page or modal. 

## Usage 

Use hints to share information about an interaction or prerequisite step that might not be immediately obvious to the user. 

<img src="./img/hint-layout.png" alt="blue hint at the top of an application page" width="750"/> 

## Content 
Use full sentences with punctuation.
Include relevant links to documentation when necessary.
